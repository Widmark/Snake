No specific requirements for MVC, do your best. Yes, the arrowkeys shall only be used to controll the snake. When the snake hits it self the game ends. The snake is allowed to enter the right end of the screen and will then exit the left end of the screen, similar if it enters the top of the screen it continues to move up from the bottom etc. Yes there is a GUI. i big back square which the snake will move acrose. The snake shall move with a constant speed and when pressing the arrows the snake will change direction. Use the libraries that you think is needed.
